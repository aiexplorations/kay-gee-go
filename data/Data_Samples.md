# Summary

1. These data samples were created by running the app - `docker-compose build && docker-compose up`
2. The Neo4J database was populated with these nodes and edges by the backend
3. Said data was then brought here in the form of a JSON file which preserves node and edge information
4. The seed concept in each case was "Artificial Intelligence" and other concepts were populated based on the logic of topic mining and graph creation implemented in `kg-builder/internal` under the `llm` and `graph` sections.
